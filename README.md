# Tic-Tac-Toe Scala Starter

This is a Scala/SBT project that consists of following modules:
* __api__ - contains object that will be used in client/server or peer2peer games
* __console__ - you can start the game in console and play with it (real AI will be added later)
* __domain__ - contains game's rules and board (3x3 so far)
* __spark__ - TODO - SparkML will be used for out tic-tac-to AI
* __web__ - TODO - webapp (based on Play framework) to play Tic-Tac-Toe in browser
* __akka__ - TODO - used for peer2peer communication between players - no central server is required 


### Running
